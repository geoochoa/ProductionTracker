# Movie Production Tracker Web App

# Why
Movie databases only emphasize currently released movies. I like knowing what various crew members plan to work and manuevering sites to find this information is repetitive and boring. I find out about new projects and people through these databases so I thought it would be nice to have an efficient way to browse this all. Overall, the goal was to create an application that would better inform me what is going on behind the scenes in production.
